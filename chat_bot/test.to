They all break down somewhere. Decimal can't represent 1/3 losslessly, but fractions can't represent sqr(2) losslessly. The advantage of decimal representation is that you can ensure an arbitrary degree of precision by requiring a certain number of sig figs and doing all adding starting with the smallest pair of numbers.
