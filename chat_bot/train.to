I agree about the harder drugs, but it would be nice if, along with legalization of marijuana, there came a more rational viewpoint towards harder drugs too. The current hysteria over drugs really needs to end.
nope.

Exactly! If we legalize drugs but still keep up with education about them, and I mean realistic education, that would go a long way towards minimizing the drug 'problem'.
As I haven't the foggiest idea what's involved in an English degree, I'd love for you to tell me what it's all about.

Looking at those candidates, I'm thinking maybe we should eliminate the Presidency altogether.
You really believe that?  You really think that America would be strengthed by homogony of thought?
Surely it's a balance. You don't want to throttle new feature dev because of a bug... or you'd end up polishing a turd. Equally, you don't want to race ahead of practicalities in the pursuit of an impossible feature. 20 bugs sounds about right to me (?).

Yeah, thanks for sharing.. But from what I saw in the film and read in the book, it was heroin that fucked him up, the toxiplasmosis was but an unexplored sideplot.

Google and your street address?

When did reddit become home to so many misogynists? Judging by the comments on many recent stories, they seem to have overrun the place.

Poor Lou.  He's going through life with a Kick Me sign on his back. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar What's that?  You don't see anything? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Doesn't matter.  He *knows* it's there.
It may be. But in the meantime we really _believe_ we have free will. That's no more rational than the belief in a soul or afterlife, is it?
Holy shit.  Torturing your own kid is bad enough, but posting it for everyone in the world to see is criminal.
No.
Oh, are you getting the feeling you're *not welcome* here? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Whatever gave you *that* impression? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 
Hmmm, someone who uses the word 'retarded' in this day and age wants us to believe ads with sex appeal are ineffective. Interesting.
It's just like a fishbulb effect, compared to some of the things they do with those patterns it's pretty pathetic. There's flat, non-moving ones that give you the sensation that everything's being twisted clockwise (or anti-clockwise), which can make you feel sea sick.
Which registrar would you recommend?
My point exactly...
Those who identify as atheist but don't evangelize probably don't tell you they identify as atheist. I, for example, would seldom mention the area at all and, if directly asked, would go with 'I'm not religious' as my first answer.
That only depends on what you do with them...

They're currently both at fault - it's just that the Democratic Congress has the advantage of the moral high ground, and are squandering it.  That doesn't excuse Bush.

Shh....  we can't let people know reddit is biased.
I wholeheartedly agree.
Personally, I don't care, one way or the other.  But, I just think it would be funny to see ONE pro-conservative article make it to the top.  If the founders intended for their to be more than one party, a healthy information source like reddit should represent that.
Yea, it does.

Squaring is a multiplication of two numbers (multiplying one number by itself). The proposition in the title (and in the expression *x*^0) is that you are multiplying *no* numbers, and the article says that the result has numerical value 1.

India's high growth makes it a desirable investment market, and so traders are willing to put up with transaction taxes.  When the economy matures, and bear markets hit, I wouldn't be surprised if the transaction tax is removed.

I think, for the purposes of this discussion, 'beliefs' can be assumed to mean the unfalsifiable kind, such as 'God exists' / 'God does not exist.'  To the extent that that's the case, truth doesn't enter into it...any is as good as the next.

Sure, but what do they get from Israel, which doesn't seem to have a lot to offer?  Support for the Saudis (for example) makes sense as there's oil to be had.  What do they get from Israel except a headache?

1% is a lot, when you're talking about the population of the united states. Do you really believe it's misleading to talk about 700 per 100,000 in jail in the US versus 29 per 100,000 in India as a significant difference?

A few thousand years' trend toward monogamy doesn't erase the instincts evolved over the previous millions.  Society is more emotionally willing to send men to early death than women, and mark7's explanation is the reason.

I agree about the harder drugs, but it would be nice if, along with legalization of marijuana, there came a more rational viewpoint towards harder drugs too. The current hysteria over drugs really needs to end.
nope.
Except that the value of our country has tanked in the process.  Useful failure?  See how many people would go back and change it in exchange for not having the knowledge of how bad things can get.
Exactly! If we legalize drugs but still keep up with education about them, and I mean realistic education, that would go a long way towards minimizing the drug 'problem'.

Even if the patterns of your brain reoccur exactly at some point in the distant future, you're unlikely to perceive that as continuation of your existence. Secondly, the probability of the pattern reoccurring is extremely low and the heat death of the universe is more likely to prevent that anyway.

It was impressive that they move to checkmate, and the black king falls when he loses. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I've never seen auto moving chess sets, but I'm surprised it would make the king fall when a side loses.
A meaningless statistic, we've only kept records for a very short period of time.  Jesus, we've survived Ice Ages.  I believe they are usually followed by a period of global warming.
Religion has fallen a long way since Boethius, Augustine and Thomas Aquinas.  Ignorance is a central pillar of theism in the modern world, probably because science has explained a vast number of things that used to be by 'divine will.'
He's a genius. The 'young man' part is the giveaway. I suspect he just slipped that in to distinguish his satire from the stupidity it satirizes. newlinechar  newlinechar

Interesting to see so much down votes on fairly objective article.  Looks like AIPAC members lurk around reddit too.
I am not so sure this is a strictly statistical issue. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I would be embarrassed to fire even one employee and then immediately accept a pay-rise.

You're supposed to tip UPS drivers now?  For one thing, they never stay around long enough to collect.   For another, I'm pretty sure they aren't making $2.25 an hour, or whatever waiters get paid these days.
why?  it is all done with magnets anyway, they just flip the magnet.
If you make x votes in rapid succession, reddit stops listening to your votes--permanently.

Declarative is the contrast to imperative, not recursive (or functional, which is probably what he meant to say). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Recursion is a single technique (that's usually enabled for general uses by your compiler doing tail call optimization), not a programming paradigm.

Paul Grahamも「ハードは自分で作れ」って言っているしね。私もそっちの意見に惹かれるんだけど、最近Square時代の上司と話をしてて、「手製のPCクラスタ上で、細い回線やI/O幅を頑張ってカバーする分散環境を作ったり物理的に収納する場所のやりくりに悩んだりすることにリソースを割くより、ぶっといバスと大量のメモリを持つブレードサーバをがつんと買ってそのへんを解決済みにして、その上の層にリソースを割いた方がいいんじゃない?」と言われて、まあそれも条件によっては一理あるかなと。 newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 条件っていうのは資金や人的リソースの話で。人に比べてハードは安くなったから、特に人が少なく、スケールの上限もある程度見えている場合は、貴重な開発力をハードの組み立てと保守に取られるくらいなら、っていうのはわかる。 newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 1998年前後だったと思うけど、Pixarを訪問してサーバとか見せてもらった時に、それまでPC並べてたのをSparcのマルチCPUラックサーバに移行して場所も取らなくなったし保守も楽になったって話を聞いたような覚えもある。その後Squareではフロアひとつ潰して1000台の手作りPCによるファームを組んだけど、保守は確かに大変そうだった。 newlinechar  newlinechar

How the heck has Ruby gotten more complex?  With every new version they remove more and more line noise and Perlisms.  If anything, it's gotten LESS complex but more ADVANCED in terms of functionality.

PHP was created so that monkeys could create CGI scripts. It replaces Perl in that sense.
Linux Kernel in a Nutshell is on a quite different level from the McKusick book. You need something more like 'Understanding the Linux Kernel,' by Daniel Plerre Bovet and Marco Cesati.

With the money Trump stands to gain from the capital gains tax cuts, I find it notable that a hyper-successful capitalist like Trump is willing to speak out.
For every hot woman on Craigslist, there's a brigade of meat-heads willing to email pictures of their junk with contact information. Is that guy still alive?
I strongly doubt the permanent part of that sentence. Unless you mean, in relation to that person, which would explain a great deal.

A CEO's job isn't to hire as many employees as possible -- it's to hire the optimum number of employees. Anything else is measuring success in terms of effort required -- which celebrates inefficiency.

Okay, they're not actually magnetic -- they simply respond to magnetic fields. But you try explaining all that in an attractive headline.

Last I checked, they *still*  manufacture playing cards. When I was last visiting family in Turkey, they had a set of Nintendo playing cards. They were easily the highest quality playing cards I've seen in my entire life. And no, they didn't have Mario or Zelda on them.
If by 'interference pattern of gravity and magnetism' you just mean the weight of the fluid vs magnetic force, then I may agree. newlinechar  newlinechar But I bet it's more related to the surface tension of the fluid vs the magnetic force or the distribution of magnetic nanoparticles.

Hey, Kilborn was pretty good back then, although not as good as Stewart. Perhaps it's the producers who really rock. Here's a [little glimpse of what they think about the news](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/newswar/view/) (see part sixteen).
